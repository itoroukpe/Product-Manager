A **Kubernetes CRD (Custom Resource Definition)** is a powerful feature that allows you to extend the Kubernetes API by defining your own custom resourcesâ€”objects that behave like built-in Kubernetes resources (like Pods, Services, etc.), but are specific to your application or domain logic.

---

### ðŸ”¹ **What Is a CRD?**

A **Custom Resource Definition (CRD)** is a way to **register a new resource type** with the Kubernetes API server. Once registered, users can manage instances of the new type using `kubectl`, just like native resources.

For example, you can define a resource type called `BackupSchedule`, `Database`, `FooBar`, etc.

---

### ðŸ”¹ **Why Use a CRD?**

* Add new object types to Kubernetes without modifying the source code
* Build Kubernetes-native applications and controllers
* Automate lifecycle management of complex applications
* Leverage Kubernetes reconciliation pattern via Operators

---

### ðŸ”¹ **Example Use Case**

Let's say you want to manage database backups:

You can define a CRD like this:

```yaml
apiVersion: apiextensions.k8s.io/v1
kind: CustomResourceDefinition
metadata:
  name: backupschedules.example.com
spec:
  group: example.com
  versions:
    - name: v1
      served: true
      storage: true
      schema:
        openAPIV3Schema:
          type: object
          properties:
            spec:
              type: object
              properties:
                schedule:
                  type: string
                retentionDays:
                  type: integer
  scope: Namespaced
  names:
    plural: backupschedules
    singular: backupschedule
    kind: BackupSchedule
    shortNames:
      - bs
```

Once applied, you can create objects like:

```yaml
apiVersion: example.com/v1
kind: BackupSchedule
metadata:
  name: my-backup
spec:
  schedule: "0 0 * * *"
  retentionDays: 7
```

### ðŸ”¹ **How CRDs Work with Operators**

CRDs are often used with **Kubernetes Operators**, which are controllers that watch your custom resource and implement logic in response.

> For example, a `BackupScheduleController` can:
>
> * Watch all `BackupSchedule` objects
> * Run a cron job based on the `schedule`
> * Trigger backups and manage retention

| Feature       | Description                                    |
| ------------- | ---------------------------------------------- |
| **Purpose**   | Define your own Kubernetes objects             |
| **Scope**     | Namespaced or Cluster-wide                     |
| **Used with** | Controllers, Operators                         |
| **Tools**     | `kubectl`, `kubebuilder`, `controller-runtime` |
| **Benefits**  | Extends Kubernetes declarative model           |
