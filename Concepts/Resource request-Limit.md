**Resource request/limit tuning** in Kubernetes is the process of **setting and optimizing the CPU and memory resources** that containers can use‚Äî**to improve performance, avoid over-provisioning, and reduce costs**.

---

### üß† Why It Matters

Without tuning:

* **Over-provisioning** wastes resources and increases cloud costs.
* **Under-provisioning** can cause performance issues or container eviction (OOMKilled errors).

---

## ‚öôÔ∏è How It Works

Kubernetes lets you define:

* **`requests`**: the minimum guaranteed CPU/memory a container will get.
* **`limits`**: the maximum CPU/memory a container is allowed to use.

```yaml
resources:
  requests:
    memory: "256Mi"
    cpu: "250m"
  limits:
    memory: "512Mi"
    cpu: "500m"
```

---

## ‚úÖ **Steps to Implement Resource Request/Limit Tuning**

### 1. **Establish a Baseline**

* Deploy your application with conservative defaults.
* Example:

  ```yaml
  requests:
    cpu: "200m"
    memory: "256Mi"
  limits:
    cpu: "400m"
    memory: "512Mi"
  ```

---

### 2. **Monitor Usage**

Use observability tools to collect real data:

* **Prometheus + Grafana**
* **Datadog**, **Dynatrace**, or **Kubecost**
* Metrics to look for:

  * CPU usage over time (`container_cpu_usage_seconds_total`)
  * Memory working set (`container_memory_working_set_bytes`)
  * Throttling rates (`container_cpu_cfs_throttled_seconds_total`)

---

### 3. **Analyze Patterns**

* Look at CPU & memory usage during peak load.
* Identify containers that consistently:

  * Use **much less than they request** ‚Üí candidate for down-tuning.
  * Use **more than requested but under limit** ‚Üí candidate for right-sizing.
  * **Hit limits often** ‚Üí risk of throttling or eviction ‚Üí increase limit or refactor workload.

---

### 4. **Adjust Values**

Update your Helm values or YAML manifests:

```yaml
resources:
  requests:
    cpu: "100m"
    memory: "128Mi"
  limits:
    cpu: "200m"
    memory: "256Mi"
```

Or use **overrides** per environment in Helm:

```bash
helm upgrade myapp ./chart -f values-prod.yaml
```

---

### 5. **Use Vertical Pod Autoscaler (VPA)** *(Optional)*

* Automatically adjusts resource requests based on historical usage.
* Can run in "recommendation" mode to guide manual tuning.

---

### 6. **Continuously Tune**

* Set a recurring review cadence (e.g., monthly).
* Compare allocated vs. actual usage in tools like **Kubecost** to reduce waste.

---

## üö´ What to Avoid

* Don‚Äôt set limits too close to requests‚Äîleaves no headroom.
* Don‚Äôt set limits too low for Java apps or memory-hungry tasks‚Äîthey may be OOMKilled.
* Don‚Äôt leave them blank‚ÄîKubernetes may over-schedule and crash the node.

---

### üß™ Real-World Example:

> ‚ÄúIn the NGINX One platform, we implemented resource tuning by analyzing pod-level metrics in Grafana. Several services were over-requesting CPU. After a review, we adjusted requests/limits across 20+ deployments and saved \~30% on node costs. This also improved pod scheduling efficiency and reduced deployment times.‚Äù

Would you like a script or query to **extract resource usage stats from Prometheus** or a **Helm template snippet** for tuning values dynamically per environment?
