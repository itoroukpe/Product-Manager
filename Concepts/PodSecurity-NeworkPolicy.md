Great question! Here's a detailed explanation of **PodSecurityPolicies** and **NetworkPolicies** in Kubernetes clusters ‚Äî both are key components for securing workloads running inside your cluster.

---

## üîê **1. PodSecurityPolicies (PSP)** *(Deprecated)*

### üìå What It Was:

**PodSecurityPolicy (PSP)** was a Kubernetes resource that **restricted what pods could do** at the security context level.

### üö´ Status:

* **Deprecated in Kubernetes v1.21**
* **Removed in v1.25**
* Replaced by **Pod Security Admission (PSA)** or other tools like **OPA/Gatekeeper**.

---

### üß± PSP Controlled Things Like:

| Feature                   | Description                                       |
| ------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------- |
| Privileged mode           | Can the pod run as `privileged: true`?            |
| Host networking           | Can it use host networking or ports?              |
| Volume types              | What storage types are allowed (e.g., `hostPath`) |
| Run as non-root           | Must containers run as non-root users?            |
| Capabilities              | Limit Linux capabilities (e.g., `NET_ADMIN`)      |
| Seccomp/AppArmor profiles | What runtime security profiles are allowed?       |

---

### üßæ Example PSP YAML (deprecated):

```yaml
apiVersion: policy/v1beta1
kind: PodSecurityPolicy
metadata:
  name: restricted
spec:
  privileged: false
  runAsUser:
    rule: MustRunAsNonRoot
  seLinux:
    rule: RunAsAny
  volumes:
    - configMap
    - emptyDir
    - projected
    - secret
```

---

## ‚úÖ Modern Alternative: **Pod Security Admission (PSA)**

### üß† What It Does:

PSA is a built-in admission controller that **enforces security levels** on namespaces using **labels**.

| Profile      | Behavior                                 |
| ------------ | ---------------------------------------- |
| `privileged` | No restrictions (least secure)           |
| `baseline`   | Blocks known privilege escalations       |
| `restricted` | Most secure ‚Äî minimal privileges allowed |

### üßæ Example:

```bash
kubectl label ns my-app-ns pod-security.kubernetes.io/enforce=restricted
```

---

## üåê **2. NetworkPolicies**

### üìå What It Is:

**NetworkPolicy** is a Kubernetes resource that **controls pod-to-pod, pod-to-service, and ingress/egress traffic** in a cluster.

> By default, all pods can talk to all other pods. NetworkPolicies let you **restrict traffic**.

---

### üß± What You Can Control:

| Type      | Description                              |
| --------- | ---------------------------------------- |
| Ingress   | What can **connect to** your pod         |
| Egress    | Where your pod is **allowed to connect** |
| Selectors | Use pod labels to apply rules            |

---

### üßæ Example: Allow Ingress Only From Specific App

```yaml
apiVersion: networking.k8s.io/v1
kind: NetworkPolicy
metadata:
  name: allow-from-api
  namespace: my-namespace
spec:
  podSelector:
    matchLabels:
      app: db
  ingress:
    - from:
        - podSelector:
            matchLabels:
              app: api
```

This allows only pods labeled `app=api` to reach pods labeled `app=db`.

---

### üßæ Example: Egress Deny All Except DNS

```yaml
apiVersion: networking.k8s.io/v1
kind: NetworkPolicy
metadata:
  name: egress-policy
spec:
  podSelector: {}
  egress:
    - to:
        - namespaceSelector: {}
          podSelector:
            matchLabels:
              k8s-app: kube-dns
  policyTypes:
    - Egress
```

---

## üîê Combined Impact:

| Layer   | Tool          | Protects Against                         |
| ------- | ------------- | ---------------------------------------- |
| Runtime | PSA / PSP     | Privilege escalation, bad configs        |
| Network | NetworkPolicy | Lateral movement, unapproved connections |

---

## ‚úÖ Best Practices

* Apply **`restricted` PSA** to production namespaces.
* Start with **deny-all NetworkPolicy**, then allow what‚Äôs needed.
* Use **CI/CD validation** to ensure policies are present in PRs.
* Use CNI plugins that support NetworkPolicies (e.g., Calico, Cilium, Weave).
