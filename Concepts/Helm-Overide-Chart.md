**Environment-specific Helm overrides** refer to the customization of Helm chart values for different deployment environments—such as **development**, **staging**, and **production**—by supplying different configuration files or values during deployment.

---

### 🧠 **Why this is important:**

In Kubernetes, environments often have different needs:

* **Dev** might use fewer replicas, lower resource limits, and mock services.
* **Prod** needs full resource scaling, tighter security, monitoring, and backups.

Using environment-specific overrides ensures that:

* The **same Helm chart** can be used across environments.
* Each environment has the appropriate configuration without duplicating code or templates.

---

### ⚙️ **How it works:**

Let’s say your base `values.yaml` in your Helm chart looks like this:

```yaml
replicaCount: 2
image:
  repository: my-app
  tag: latest
resources:
  limits:
    cpu: "500m"
    memory: "512Mi"
```

You can define **override files** like:

#### 🧪 `values-dev.yaml`

```yaml
replicaCount: 1
image:
  tag: dev
resources:
  limits:
    cpu: "200m"
    memory: "256Mi"
```

#### 🚀 `values-prod.yaml`

```yaml
replicaCount: 5
image:
  tag: stable
resources:
  limits:
    cpu: "1000m"
    memory: "1024Mi"
```

Then deploy with:

```bash
# For development
helm install my-app ./my-chart -f values-dev.yaml

# For production
helm upgrade my-app ./my-chart -f values-prod.yaml
```

You can also pass in overrides via CLI:

```bash
helm install my-app ./my-chart --set image.tag=dev --set replicaCount=1
```

### ✅ **Benefits:**

* Promotes **reusability**: one chart, many configurations.
* Reduces **human error**: clear separation of environment concerns.
* Helps with **CI/CD pipelines** by keeping configuration declarative and environment-specific.
