A **prioritization matrix** and **prioritization models** are tools used by product managers, engineers, and business leaders to systematically decide **what features, tasks, or initiatives to work on first**—based on **impact, effort, value, urgency, risk**, or other criteria.

## 🔳 **What is a Prioritization Matrix?**

A **prioritization matrix** is a **2x2 grid** that helps visualize and categorize tasks/features based on two main dimensions, such as:

### ✅ Common Matrix: **Impact vs. Effort**

|                 | **Low Effort**           | **High Effort**           |
| --------------- | ------------------------ | ------------------------- |
| **High Impact** | 💎 **Quick Wins**        | 🚀 **Strategic Projects** |
| **Low Impact**  | 🧹 **Low-Hanging Fruit** | ❌ **Time Wasters**        |

Use this matrix when you want to:

* Maximize ROI on engineering time.
* Prioritize features that bring fast results.
* Justify why some features aren’t worth building.

## 📊 **Common Prioritization Models**

These are frameworks used to assign scores and make **data-driven decisions**.

---

### 1. **RICE Scoring**

Used to prioritize roadmap items based on:

* **Reach** – How many users will it impact?
* **Impact** – How big is the impact per user?
* **Confidence** – How sure are we about the above numbers?
* **Effort** – How much time/resources will it take?

**Formula:**

```
RICE = (Reach × Impact × Confidence) / Effort
```

✅ **Best for:** Product teams managing large backlogs with limited resources.

---

### 2. **MoSCoW Method**

Breaks features into categories:

* **M**ust have
* **S**hould have
* **C**ould have
* **W**on’t have (for now)

✅ **Best for:** Communicating priorities to stakeholders clearly.

---

### 3. **Value vs. Complexity Matrix**

Like Impact vs. Effort, but “value” is often broader (includes revenue, retention, user satisfaction), and “complexity” can include technical risk, integrations, and regulatory concerns.

✅ **Best for:** Engineering-driven projects or platform investments.

---

### 4. **Kano Model**

Categorizes features based on how they affect customer satisfaction:

* **Basic needs** – Expected, no delight
* **Performance needs** – More = better
* **Delighters** – Unexpected but loved
* **Indifferent** – No impact on satisfaction
* **Reverse** – Too much = bad experience

✅ **Best for:** Customer experience and UX teams.

---

### 5. **Weighted Scoring**

You define custom criteria (e.g., revenue potential, risk reduction, alignment with goals) and assign weights and scores for each feature.

✅ **Best for:** Enterprise and stakeholder-heavy environments where decisions must be justified with clear reasoning.

## 🧠 How You Might Use This in Interviews

> “We used a **RICE matrix** during backlog grooming, especially when balancing tech debt and new features. It helped us identify high-reach, low-effort initiatives we could slot into the next sprint while aligning with KPIs like customer satisfaction and operational cost savings.”
