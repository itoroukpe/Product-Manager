Here's a clear breakdown of **SOC 2** and **ISO 27001**, two of the most common and important **information security compliance standards**—especially for organizations building SaaS platforms, cloud-native products, and Kubernetes-based services.

## 🔐 **SOC 2 vs. ISO 27001 Overview**

| Feature        | **SOC 2**                                     | **ISO 27001**                                         |
| -------------- | --------------------------------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------- |
| **Full Name**  | Service Organization Control Type 2           | ISO/IEC 27001: International Standard for ISMS        |
| **Scope**      | Evaluates **controls around data security**   | Framework for managing **information security risks** |
| **Audience**   | Primarily for **U.S.** customers and auditors | Recognized **globally**                               |
| **Focus Area** | Trust Services Criteria (TSC)                 | Information Security Management System (ISMS)         |
| **Audit Type** | Attestation report (Type I or II)             | Certification audit (by an accredited body)           |
| **Renewal**    | Annual                                        | 3-year cycle with annual surveillance audits          |
| **Output**     | Auditor’s report                              | ISO 27001 certificate                                 |

## 📜 **SOC 2 – Key Concepts**

SOC 2 is based on **AICPA's Trust Services Criteria (TSC):**

1. **Security (Required)** – Protection from unauthorized access
2. **Availability** – System is available for operation
3. **Processing Integrity** – System processing is complete and accurate
4. **Confidentiality** – Data is protected from unauthorized disclosure
5. **Privacy** – Personal information is collected and used appropriately

### ✅ You must:

* Implement **access controls** (e.g., RBAC, MFA)
* Have **audit logs** and retain them
* Ensure **incident response plans** are in place
* Apply **change management** and CI/CD governance
* Prove these controls **actually work over time** (Type II audit)

---

## 📜 **ISO 27001 – Key Concepts**

ISO 27001 defines the **Information Security Management System (ISMS)** — a structured framework for managing sensitive company and customer data.

### ✅ It requires:

* A **risk assessment and treatment plan**
* Clear **information security policies**
* Roles and responsibilities defined (e.g., Data Owner, CISO)
* Regular **security training and awareness**
* Incident response, business continuity, and recovery planning
* **Controls from ISO 27002** (114 controls grouped into domains):

  * Access control
  * Cryptography
  * Operations security
  * Supplier relationships
  * Physical security

## 🔄 **How They Relate to Kubernetes / Cloud Platforms**

If you're running Kubernetes-based applications, both standards expect you to have controls for:

| Area                    | Examples of Controls Expected                 |
| ----------------------- | --------------------------------------------- |
| **Access Management**   | RBAC in Kubernetes, IAM policies              |
| **Data Encryption**     | TLS, secrets encrypted at rest and in transit |
| **Audit Logging**       | Control plane and app-level logs (e.g., EFK)  |
| **Vulnerability Mgmt.** | Image scanning, dependency tracking           |
| **Backup & DR**         | Snapshot and restore for persistent volumes   |
| **Patch Management**    | Regular node and container updates            |
| **Incident Response**   | Runbooks, alerts, forensic data availability  |

## ✅ **Preparing for SOC 2 / ISO 27001 Certification**

| Step                        | Description                                       |
| --------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------- |
| Perform Gap Assessment      | Identify missing controls                         |
| Implement Security Controls | Across infrastructure, apps, policies             |
| Document Policies           | Access, encryption, monitoring, incident response |
| Automate Where Possible     | CI/CD controls, policy-as-code, logging           |
| Choose Auditors             | SOC 2: CPA firm; ISO: Accredited Certifier        |
| Track Everything            | Logs, evidence, screenshots                       |

### 🎯 Example in Practice:

> “While working on The Gazel platform, we aligned our Kubernetes infrastructure to **SOC 2 Security and Availability criteria** by implementing RBAC, centralized logging with Loki, encrypted secrets with Vault, and access auditing with OPA policies. We also enforced CI/CD validation for all YAML changes to reduce misconfigurations.”
