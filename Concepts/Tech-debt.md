### 🧾 What is **Tech Debt** (Technical Debt)?

**Technical debt** is the **cost of choosing a quick or easy solution today** instead of using a better, more time-consuming, or sustainable approach. It refers to **code, architecture, infrastructure, or process decisions** that may work for now but **accumulate problems over time**—slowing down development, increasing bugs, and making systems harder to scale or maintain.

## 🧠 Tech Debt = Tradeoff

Just like financial debt, you get speed **now**, but you **pay interest later** in the form of:

* More time to add new features
* More bugs or outages
* More complex refactoring work
* Slower onboarding of new engineers

## 📚 Types of Technical Debt

| Type                          | Example                                                    |
| ----------------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Deliberate/Strategic**      | “We’ll ship now and refactor later”                        |
| **Inadvertent/Unintentional** | Poor coding due to lack of experience or knowledge         |
| **Aging Code/Legacy Debt**    | Old frameworks, unsupported libraries, hardcoded logic     |
| **Process Debt**              | Manual deployments, lack of tests or automation            |
| **Infrastructure Debt**       | Monoliths, hardcoded scaling, lack of observability or IaC |

## 💬 Real-World Example:

> “We hardcoded a config value into the codebase to meet a release deadline. It worked for the demo, but later we had to extract it into a config map, refactor multiple services, and create rollback logic. That was technical debt we deliberately took on but had to repay.”

---

## 🔄 How It Happens:

* Rushed releases
* Lack of testing
* Not following coding standards
* Missing documentation
* Avoiding refactoring
* Ignoring platform or security updates

## ✅ How to Manage Tech Debt

### 1. **Acknowledge and Track It**

* Use Jira or GitHub issues to log tech debt just like features or bugs.
* Tag with labels like `tech-debt`, `refactor`, or `legacy`.

### 2. **Prioritize It**

Use models like:

* **Impact vs. Effort Matrix**
* **RICE scoring**
* Include debt tickets in regular sprint planning.

### 3. **Schedule Time to Fix It**

* Allocate 10–20% of every sprint to tech debt.
* Run “refactor Fridays” or “maintenance sprints.”

### 4. **Communicate the Cost**

* Show how it's affecting velocity, bugs, or team morale.
* Translate into business language: “This change will take 4x longer due to unrefactored components.”

## 🔧 Tech Debt ≠ Always Bad

Technical debt can be a **strategic tool** if:

* You use it to test MVPs or validate business ideas.
* You **document it clearly** and plan to fix it.

> It's **unmanaged tech debt** that becomes a problem.
