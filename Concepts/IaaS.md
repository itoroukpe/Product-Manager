### üèóÔ∏è **Infrastructure as a Service (IaaS)** ‚Äî Explained

**Infrastructure as a Service (IaaS)** is a **cloud computing model** that delivers **virtualized computing resources** over the internet. Instead of purchasing and maintaining physical hardware, organizations can **rent compute, storage, and networking** from a cloud provider and scale on demand.

---

## üß± **What IaaS Provides**

At a high level, IaaS gives you:

| Component      | Description                                                    |
| -------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Compute**    | Virtual machines (VMs), autoscaling groups                     |
| **Storage**    | Block (e.g., EBS), file (e.g., EFS), object storage (e.g., S3) |
| **Networking** | VPCs, load balancers, firewalls, VPNs                          |
| **Other**      | DNS, monitoring, security controls                             |

You manage **OS, middleware, and apps**‚Äîthe provider manages **infrastructure**.

### ‚òÅÔ∏è **Examples of IaaS Providers**

| Provider            | Product/Service                          |
| ------------------- | ---------------------------------------- |
| **AWS**             | EC2, EBS, VPC, ELB                       |
| **Microsoft Azure** | Azure VMs, Blob Storage, Virtual Network |
| **Google Cloud**    | Compute Engine, Cloud Storage, VPC       |
| **IBM Cloud**       | Virtual Servers, Object Storage          |
| **Oracle Cloud**    | OCI Compute and Networking               |

## üîÅ **IaaS vs Other Cloud Models**

| Model    | You Manage               | Provider Manages                             |
| -------- | ------------------------ | -------------------------------------------- |
| **IaaS** | OS, apps, runtime, data  | Servers, storage, networking, virtualization |
| **PaaS** | Apps and data            | OS, middleware, runtime, infrastructure      |
| **SaaS** | Just use the application | Everything else                              |

## üß† **Why Use IaaS?**

* **Scalability**: Quickly scale resources up/down.
* **Cost Efficiency**: Pay-as-you-go pricing.
* **Speed**: Launch servers in minutes instead of weeks.
* **Control**: You manage OS, security policies, runtime, etc.
* **Flexibility**: Run any software stack or container orchestration platform (e.g., Kubernetes).

---

## üß∞ **Use Cases**

* Hosting web apps or microservices.
* Setting up a Kubernetes cluster (e.g., EKS, AKS, GKE).
* Dev/test environments.
* Backup and disaster recovery.
* Virtual desktop infrastructure.

---

## üîê **Security and Compliance Considerations**

Even though you don't manage the physical hardware, you're responsible for:

* OS patching and hardening.
* Network ACLs and security groups.
* Identity & Access Management (IAM).
* Encryption of data at rest and in transit.

---

### ‚úÖ Real-World Example:

> ‚ÄúWe used **AWS IaaS (EC2, S3, ELB)** to host our Kubernetes-based tax platform. The infrastructure scaled with demand, and we had full control over the OS, runtime, and security configurations. This gave us the flexibility of on-prem with the agility of cloud.‚Äù

---
Here‚Äôs a **sample cloud architecture** for deploying a **Kubernetes cluster on IaaS**, typically using **AWS**, **Azure**, or **GCP**. This setup balances scalability, availability, and security, and is suitable for hosting production-grade containerized applications.
